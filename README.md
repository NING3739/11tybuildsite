# Personal Portfolio Site

Hey! I'm Ning, a passionate Web Developer and Data Science enthusiast! Proficient in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Python, Flask, Vue, and R. Currently, I am diving deep into the realms of data visualization and statistic modeling.

On this website, I mainly showcase the projects I've worked on in the past, as well as the new knowledge I've recently acquired, and my daily reflections. I provide GitHub repository links for any coding-related work for you to review. If you have any feedback or exciting ideas, I'm very open to discussing them with you. Let's learn new things together and experience the joy of coding.

Thank you!
